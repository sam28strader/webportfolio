<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
This image was created for a project for a Digital Media class I took in my senior year of college at the University of Pittsburgh. I wanted to create an ad that would be beneficial for my career after college, so I decided to make an ad for the MLS professional soccer team, Charlotte FC, using a photoshop application called GIMP. I was able to learn multiple skills for photo editing during this assignment and start thinking about different ways ads can be effective for sports teams.
