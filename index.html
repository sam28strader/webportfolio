<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Sam Strader and I am currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh. I am a marketing major with a digital media certificate as well. I work at Red Bull and my passion is going into sports marketing, which would include marketing, but also digital media and social media. After I was able to meet with two people during the summer that work at Charlotte FC, I fell in love with the idea of working in sports because I knew I wanted to be passionate about my work and I wanted to be surrounded in that area of entertainment. Since then, I have been able to volunteer at a few Charlotte FC games to help out, shadow the control room at the University of Pittsburgh athletics department during a soccer game, work for the production team at multiple sporting events, create an ad for Charlotte FC, and I started to learn how to video edit to increase my skill set. This website was made to showcase my passion for the industry and prove that I am doing the most in my ability to become an asset for anyone coming out of college.</p>
