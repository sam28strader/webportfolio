<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
This video was created for the purpose of being used on social media, more specifically, Tik Tok. After learning a lot about what videos and editing techniques are popular and attract the most amount of views and engagement, I wanted to gain more experience in this field for my career. I used what I learned to create videos that would be effective for sports teams, as well as the sports industry.
